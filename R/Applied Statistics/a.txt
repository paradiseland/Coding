For the listed companies (ST companies) in A-share market that were trapped in financial difficulties in 2009, the financial data of 8 ST companies in the year before they were trapped in financial difficulties (2008) were collected. For the companies with good financial performance (non-ST companies), the corresponding financial data of 8 non-ST companies in the same year were collected. Four variables are as follows: asset liability ratio x1, current asset turnover ratio x2, total asset return ratio x3 and operating revenue growth rate x4. For classified variable G, 2 represents ST company and 1 represents non-ST company. See attached table for relevant data.           
 (1) Establish linear discriminant, nonlinear discriminant, distance discriminant (homoscedasticity and heteroscedasticity respectively) and Bayes discriminant models respectively, calculate their discriminant coincidence rates respectively and determine which discriminant method is the most appropriate.            
 (2) The financial data of a company in 2008 is x1 = 78.3563, x2 = 0.8895, x3 = 1.8001, x4 = 14.1022. Try to determine whether the company will be in financial difficulties in 2009.
