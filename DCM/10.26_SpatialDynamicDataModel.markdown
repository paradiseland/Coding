### A Spatial dynamic panel data model with both time and individual fixed effects.
This paper establishes asymptotic properties of quasi-maximum likelihood estima-
tors for spatial dynamic panel data with both time and individual fixed effects when
the number of individuals n and the number of time periods T can be large. 
>### **1.introduction**
for dynamic panel data model 
there is time effects.
